Why Book Management System ?

Maintaining member records, book records, and account details manually are extremely time-consuming. 
Other problems faced in libraries include finding any particular book, finding out if it is available, 
when it will be available, searching by categories, keeping track of active issues, etc. 
To eliminate this manual system, Book Management System has been developed.
